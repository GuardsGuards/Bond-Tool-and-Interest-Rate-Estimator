# üìå Capital Markets & Risk: Interest Rate Modeling & Pricing Project

## A Python & Flask-based application for advanced interest rate modeling, bond pricing, risk analytics, and financial backtesting.

---

### üìñ Project Overview

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive toolkit for **interest rate modeling** and **bond pricing**, incorporating advanced financial models and real-world data. The project combines **jump diffusion**, **exogenous factors** (such as inflation and money velocity), and **refinements to traditional models** like the **CIR (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross)** and **Hull-White models** to deliver a more accurate and robust framework for financial analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### 1. **Interest Rate Modeling**
   - **Jump Diffusion**: Incorporates sudden jumps in interest rates, modeled using parameters Œª (jump intensity), Œº_J (mean jump size), and œÉ_J (jump volatility).
   - **Exogenous Factors**: Integrates external drivers like **inflation** and **money velocity (M2V)** to refine the interest rate projections.
   - **CIR + Hull-White Hybrid Model**: Combines the strengths of the **CIR model** (for non-negative rates) and the **Hull-White model** (for mean-reversion and time-dependent drift) to create a more realistic interest rate simulation.
   - **Time-Dependent Drift**: Captures trends in interest rates using a time-dependent drift term calibrated from historical data.

### 2. **Bond Analytics**
   - **Bond Pricing**: Computes bond prices based on yield, maturity, face value, and coupon rate.
   - **Total Return Analysis**: Calculates the total return and annualized return if the bond is held to maturity.
   - **Duration & Convexity**: Measures the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes using **Macaulay Duration**, **Modified Duration**, and **Convexity**.
   - **Binomial Tree Pricing**: Prices bonds using a binomial tree model, with support for **callable** and **putable** bonds.

### 3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - **Interactive Plots**: Visualizes historical and projected interest rates, bond prices, and risk metrics using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
   - **Heatmaps**: Displays bond prices at different nodes and time steps in a binomial tree model.
   - **Summary Tables**: Provides detailed analytics for bond pricing, returns, duration, and convexity.

## üß© Project Structure

### 1. **Interest Rate Tool**
   - **Combines Jump Diffusion, Exogenous Factors, and Refined CIR/Hull-White Models**:
     - **Jump Diffusion**: Models sudden changes in interest rates using calibrated parameters (Œª, Œº_J, œÉ_J).
     - **Exogenous Factors**: Incorporates inflation and money velocity trends to refine the interest rate projections.
     - **CIR + Hull-White Hybrid**: Ensures non-negative rates and captures mean-reversion and time-dependent drift.
   - **Output**: Projected interest rates with confidence intervals, visualized alongside historical data.

### 2. **Bond Pricing Tool**
   - **Bond Price Calculation**: Computes bond prices using yield, maturity, face value, and coupon rate.
   - **Total Return Analysis**: Calculates gross and annualized returns for bonds held to maturity.
   - **Duration & Convexity**: Measures interest rate sensitivity and curvature of the bond price-yield relationship.
   - **Binomial Tree Pricing**: Prices bonds with optional embedded call or put features using a binomial tree model.
